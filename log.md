# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#### Day 0: August 4, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Created a chic digital clock using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and started working on the CSS for the analog version.

**Thoughts:** Explored the Date() method. Working out the CSS for the analog clock version is a task. Requires much more detail than the digital clock.

### Day 1: August 5, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on finishing my analog clock and worked through some Regex exercises on www.freecodecamp.org.
**Thoughts**: It's definitely a learning process. I had to spend some time working out how to create movement of the clock arms with JS. I enjoyed exploring neumorphism for the UI/design.<br>

### Day 2: August 6, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Today I started working through a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/) to learn how to build a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JS. I started crafting the design with CSS. <br>
**Thoughts**: Working with CSS definitely requires a certain level of finesse ðŸ™ƒ<br>

### Day 3: August 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Created a loading animation with CSS following this great [guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-delightful-loading-screen-in-5-minutes-847991da509f/). Also, learned some good practices for [CSS naming conventions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/)<br>
**Thoughts**: CSS animations are fun.<br>
